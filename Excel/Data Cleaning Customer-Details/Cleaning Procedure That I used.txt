				Address Number 22 Fioye Crescent Surulere Lagos Age 17 Gender Male

	2.	then I removed first word from the cell 'Address' from the cell after that it look like  "Number 22 Fioye Crescent Surulere Lagos Age 17 Gender Male"
			        
				using the law is [=IFERROR(RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND(" ",A1)),A1)]

                            
	3.	For Gender : I just extract last word from the list/ colum  using this formula [ =TRIM(RIGHT(SUBSTITUTE(A2," ",REPT(" ",10)),10)) ]
				      
				Number 22 Fioye Crescent Surulere Lagos Age 17 Gender Male

	4.      Then I deleted last word "Male/female" from column using [=IFERROR(LEFT(A1,FIND("~",SUBSTITUTE(A1," ","~",LEN(A1)-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))))-1),A1)]


				Number 22 Fioye Crescent Surulere Lagos Age 17 Gender.
